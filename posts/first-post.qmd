My goals in MicroPs are to learn more about digital electronic systems and build my own project! My initial idea for a project is to make a custom soundboard because I love repeating vocal stims and I think it would be funny and extremely fun to have my own soundboard. However, I don't know if that would be too easy or hard for the scope of this class so I might change or tweak it later. I'm also a CS major and I wanted to develop at least some skills that aren't as easily replaceable by artificial intelligence.
